# 🧠 Low-Level Design (LLD) in C++

Welcome to the **Low-Level Design (LLD)** practice repository using **C++**! This repo helps you master system design fundamentals through practical object-oriented design, C++-specific examples, and scalable mini-projects.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is designed to help you crack **LLD interviews** and improve your **real-world design skills** using core **C++ OOP principles**, **design patterns**, and **modular architecture**.

> This project is ideal for:
>
> * Software Engineers preparing for system design interviews
> * Backend/Systems programmers looking to upskill in design
> * C++ learners seeking practical object-oriented modeling experience

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you're comfortable with these **C++ concepts**:

* ✅ Classes and Objects, Access Specifiers
* ✅ OOP Concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation
* ✅ Constructors, Destructors, Rule of 3 / Rule of 5
* ✅ Virtual Functions, Abstract Classes
* ✅ Memory Management: `new`, `delete`, Smart Pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`)
* ✅ STL Containers: `vector`, `map`, `unordered_map`, `set`
* ✅ Function Overloading, Operator Overloading
* ✅ Namespaces, Exception Handling
* ✅ Writing Clean, Modular, and Readable C++ Code

You’ll find examples for all of these inside the `/01_prerequisites/` folder.
