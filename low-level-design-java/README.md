## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before diving into LLD, ensure you’re familiar with the following Java concepts:

- ✅ Java Syntax and Basics (Loops, Arrays, Strings)
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming in Java
- ✅ Interfaces, Abstract Classes, Access Modifiers
- ✅ Static/Final/This/Super/Enum Usage
- ✅ Collections Framework (`List`, `Map`, `Set`)
